# Taking part in the development

## Documentation

The [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip) command line server was used to
preview locally the Markdown flavored documentation (`.md` files).
Its installation requires `python3` and `pip` (for python3).

Once installed, use the `python3 doc/preview.py` command from the base directory
of the project to open a view on the markdown code in the default web browser.
Type CTRL+C (linux) or Command+. (MacOS) in the terminal to stop the preview.
